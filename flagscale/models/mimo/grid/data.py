"""Rank-aware data-loading utilities for MIMO (FlagScale-native).

Module data roles and DP slicing of a global micro-batch into module-local
shards.  Pure functions of explicit dataclasses and tensors, unit-testable
on CPU without process groups.

Conventions:

- Every data-loading rank samples the same global micro-batch; per-module
  DP sub-sharding is deferred to :func:`slice_batch_for_module_dp` in the
  forward step, matching the MIMO bridge's contiguous batch-dimension
  split/concatenate routing.
- Multimodal MRoPE ``position_ids`` are ``[3, batch, seq]``; their
  batch dimension is 1 (:func:`_batch_dim_for_tensor`).
- Patch-packed visual inputs (``{hidden_states, grid_thw, ...}``) use dim 0
  for different units across fields (patches vs images) and are sliced
  jointly (:func:`is_patch_packed_visual_dict`).
- Language-only ranks consume encoder outputs from the MIMO bridge; raw
  modality inputs are dropped before DP slicing
  (:func:`drop_modality_inputs`).
